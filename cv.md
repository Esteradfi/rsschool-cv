3. I am a second year student of engineering. A year ago, I wanted to learn a programming language. The choice fell on JS. Over this year, a simple interest in development has grown into a desire to work in the IT field as a frontend developer. At the moment I have experience in one project, but I want to deepen my knowledge in frontend development in order to take on more complex orders or get a job as a junior developer. That's why I came to RSS.

    function deepCount(a){
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            if (Array.isArray(a[i])) {
                count += deepCount(a[i]);
            }   
            count++;
        }
